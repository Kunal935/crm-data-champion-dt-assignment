# AI Usage Notes

This assignment leveraged AI not just for speed, but for structured thinking.

## Tools Used:
- **ChatGPT (GPT-4o)**: For brainstorming CRM flows, refining nurturing sequences, optimizing funnel stages, and simulating analytics logic.
- **Notion AI** (light use): For formatting drafts and organizing CRM fields.

## How AI Was Used:
-  Prompt Iteration: Created multiple prompt versions for CRM automation logic and tested conversational flow simulations.
-  AI as Copilot: Used ChatGPT to simulate nurturing message drafts for different lead intents (high, mid, low).
-  Analytics Debugging: Used AI to calculate conversion rates, compare CACs, and reason potential optimization experiments.

## What I Did, Not the AI:
- Thought architecture for the funnel.
- Business logic for lead qualification.
- Dashboard design thinking from stakeholder POV (Sales, Growth, CEO).
- Strategy summary and all decisions were made manually, not generated blindly.

AI was a tool â€” **not a crutch**. It helped sharpen decisions, not replace them.
