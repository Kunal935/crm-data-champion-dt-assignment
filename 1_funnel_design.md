##  Funnel Stages

| **Stage**     | **Criteria**                                                                 | **Owner**         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Lead**      | Submitted interest form or responded via inbound ads                         | Marketing         |
| **MQL**       | Matches Ideal Customer Profile (industry, company size), <br>+ Opened 2+ emails or clicked an ad | Marketing |
| **SQL**       | Booked a demo, and qualifies on BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)     | Sales             |
| **Customer**  | Signed contract or made payment                                               | Sales             |
| **Evangelist** _(Bonus)_ | Shared testimonial or referred another potential customer                     | Customer Success  |

## Logic for Evangelist Stage

In a referral-driven MSME ecosystem, customers are often influenced by peer recommendations. Creating a trackable **Evangelist** stage helps:

- Drive **high-quality inbound leads** without paid CAC.
- Encourage **advocacy** through structured incentives (testimonials, referrals).
- Close the loop between **customer delight** and **marketing pipeline**.

This stage turns customers into champions, amplifying brand trust and reach.

>  Pro Tip: Implement UTM tagging, referral codes, or testimonial tracking to measure this stage's contribution to pipeline growth.
