## Notes & Best Practices

- **High Intent**: Use conversational tone with urgency and social proof (case studies, testimonials).
- **Mid Intent**: Establish trust via founder-driven messaging and explainer content; soft CTAs.
- **Low Intent**: Keep warm with passive storytelling (e.g., milestones, impact stories, insights).

> AI tools help scale content while retaining personalization. Choose based on content type and delivery channel.
